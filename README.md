# web-scraping-challenge
This repository contains two deliverables:
* A Jupyter Notebook that scrapes titles and summaries from news articles about Mars
* Another Jupyter Notebook that scrapes weather data gathered by Curiosity and analyzes it to glean information about the Martian calendar, such as number of months, weather patterns, and the length of a Martian year in earth days, using visual aids to back up this information. It also saves the scraped data to a CSV, which is included with the two deliverables.
